### Hi there ðŸ‘‹. My name is Andrew Minkin and I'm a software engineer who is into Open Source

I care about security, data privacy, different compliances (HIPAA, GDPR, etc) and ownership. I speak Russian and English languages and I do social media stuff.

My projects:

1. [Andrew Minkin](https://t.me/retired_on_fire) - is a Russian speaking channel about everything (software engineering, stocks market mostly) 
2. [Andrew Minkin](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1ctnuRGUUXe04EgbsYXwPQ) - is a YouTube channel about programming (I do 'For Azeroth' podcast while I playing World Of Warcraft, 'OnlySource' - English speaking content about building something amazing using Go or Python programming languages). Also I stream my talks from conferences and store at my channel
3. You can ping me on telegram [@Gen1us2k](https://t.me/Gen1us2k)
4. For Russian speaking friends I write on [Habr](https://habr.com/ru/users/Gen1us2k/)
